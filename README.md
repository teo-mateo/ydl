ydl - yt downloader

For my own personal use. 
I use Youtube a lot to listen to music and often I want to dl the songs and listen to them offline in my car, from an USB stick. 
I dislike youtube downloaders because they are breaking my flow.

So I made this downloader that is running on one of my VMs. 
It has a chrome extension that lets me just click a button when I like a song, and it will be downloaded and converted to MP3 on my server; then I only need to fetch them from time to time.
